# How to create an IPsec VPN between Unifi UDM and Mikrotik firewalls

Hardware and software used
* UniFi OS UDM 1.12.22
* Unifi Network 7.2.92
* Mikrotik RouterOS v7.4

## Notes
You will find these placeholders in the configuration below and you need to replace the values
* "WAN IP of UDM" - The public IP of location with UDM
* "WAN IP of Mikrotik" - The public IP of location with Mikrotik
* "YOUR SECRET KEY" - a very long password atleast 64 characters long, best to use some password generator

## DH Groups explained
mapping for Mikrotik to UDM (Google: Diffie-Hellman Groups)
* modp1024 = DH Group 2
* modp2048 = DH Group 14

| Peer | UDM-01 |
| Auth. Method | pre shared key |
| Secret | "YOUR SECRET KEY" |
| Policy Template Group | default |
| Notrack Chain | empty |

### Select: IP -> IPsec -> Policies
| Add New IPsec Policy | |
| - | - |
| General Tab | |
| Peer | UDM-01 |
| Tunnel | checked |
| Src. Address | Mikrotik internal LAN network address (the whole network e.g. 10.0.5.0/24) |
| Src. Port | empty
| Dst. Address | UDM internal LAN network address (the whole network e.g. 192.168.5.0/24) |
| Dst. Port | empty |
| Template | unchecked |
| Action tab | |
| Action | encrypt |
| Level | unique |
| IPsec Protocols | esp |
| Proposal | UDM proposal |
| Status tab | (this will be populated once the connection is established, fields are read only) |
| PH2 Count | 1 |
| PH2 State | established |
| SA Src. Address | WAN IP of Mikrotik location (or LAN IP of router if behind NAT) |
| SA Dst. Address | WAN IP of UDM location |

### Select: IP -> Firewall -> Filter Rules
| New Firewall Rule | |
| - | - |
| Chain | input |
| Protocol | 50 (ipsec-esp) |
| In. Interface | unchecked, ether1 (could be different for you, this is the port on the router where the internet connection comes in) |
| Action | accept |
| Comment | allow L2TP VPN (ipsec-esp) |

| New Firewall Rule | |
| - | - |
| Chain | input |
| Protocol | 17 (udp) |
| Dst. Port | 500, 1701, 4500 |
| In. Interface | unchecked, ether1 (could be different for you, this is the port on the router where the internet connection comes in) |
| Action | accept |
| Comment | allow L2TP VPN (500,4500,1701/udp) |

* Move the rule to the top of the firewall Filter rules after the "defconf: accept established,related,untracked" rule.

### Select: IP -> Firewall -> NAT
| New NAT Rule | |
| - | - |
| ChainÂ | srcnat |
| Src. Address | LAN network of Mikrotik (e.g. 10.0.5.0/24) |
| Dst. Address | LAN network of UDM (e.g. 192.168.5.0/24) |
| Action | accept |

* Move the rule to the top of the firewall NAT rules.

## UDM configuration
### Settings -> Teleport & VPN -> VPN Server
| Configuration | |
| - | - |
| VPN Server | Enabled (checked) |
| VPN Protocol | L2TP |
| Pre-shared Key | "YOUR SECRET KEY for UDM" (not the same as for Mikrotik) |
| UniFi Gateway IP | "WAN IP of UDM" |
| If you want to also connect with VPN client to your UDM add a user for (Windows VPN clients enable MSCHAPv2 on network adapter). | |
| User Authentication | Create a new user, enter username and password for user (make it complex) |
| Advanced Configuration | Manual |
| Network name | VPN |
| User Access List (RADIUS Profiler) | Default |
| Gateway/Subnet | (e.g. 192.168.6.1/24) (Can't be the same as local IP range of UDM) |
| Name Server | unchecked |
| WINS Server | unchecked |
| Site-to-Site VPN | Enabled (checked) |
| Require Strong Authentication | Enabled (checked) - this is where you need MSCHAPv2 |
| Allow weak ciphers | Enabled (checked) |

### Settings -> Teleport & VPN -> Create Site-to-site VPN
| Configuration | |
| - | - |
| Name| Mikrotik-01 |
| VPN Protocol | Manual IPsec |
| Pre-shared Key | "YOUR SECRET KEY" |
| UniFi Gateway IP | "WAN IP of UDM" |
| Shared Remote Subnets | Mikrotik LAN subnet (e.g. 10.0.5.0/24) |

## Mikrotik IPsec -> Installed SAs
* Something like this should show up when connection is up

| | SPI	| Src. Address | Dst. Address |Auth. Algorithm | Encr. Algorithm | Encr. Key Size | Current Bytes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| EH | 4cbfd50 | 62.x.y.z | 83.x.y.z | sha1 | aes cbc | 128 | 0 |
| EH | c0a27199 | 83.x.y.z | 62.x.y.z | sha1 | aes cbc | 128 | 3440 |

## Ping
* You should be able to ping both ways from each location.
